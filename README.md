DESCRIPTION:
Choose a music file that you want to listen to
When a file is chosen, it's played and its waveform is visualised dynamically with coloured bars
When hovering over a bar, it is frozen in place. When hovering over a frozen bar, it is unfrozen. Clicking on any bar unfreezes all bars.


The file uses HTML, CSS and vanilla javascript
The "AudioContext" interface is used for audio processing
The height as well as the colour of bars is dependent on the loudness of their frequencies
