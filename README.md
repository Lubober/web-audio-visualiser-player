DESCRIPTION:
Choose a music file that you want to listen to
When a file is chosen, it's played and its waveform is visualised dynamically with coloured bars
When hovering over a bar, it is frozen in place. When hovering over a frozen bar, it is unfrozen. Clicking on any bar unfreezes all bars.


The file uses HTML, CSS and vanilla javascript
The "AudioContext" interface is used for audio processing
The height as well as the colour of bars is dependent on the loudness of their frequencies

It is a basic project with no intent of scalability, showcasing my programming abilities as well as my knowledge of front end
IT IS NOT RESPONSIVE(for now, making it responsive is not hard, I just don't want to do it, all I need is a few media queries, but I don't want to use them)
